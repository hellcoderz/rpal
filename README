DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
-This directory contain following files
	*token.h
	*token.cc
	*parser.h
	*parser.cc
	*p1.cc
	*makefile
	*difftest.pl

- This directory contain followingn directories:
	*BUGS - It lists all the bugs

NOTE - Output format of defns.1 differs which fails the test case otherwise the result is same

COMPILATION
	- Run make or make all to compile the code

TESTING
	-Run make test to test all the cases. I just copied the line from project website. So I am assuming all the directories will be at 
	same path as listed in project website. Otherwise please change the test in makefile

	- On local system I tested code using testing(It will not work on any other system)

CLEAN
	-cl target will remove the pl executable file

EXECUTING PROJECT
	- To execute project type " ./pl [flag] [filename] ". [flag] is optional. This is the only acceptable format. Otherwise the project will fail to run.

FLAGS
	-[-ast] - This will print the Abstract Syntax Tree of given file on standart output
	-[-debug] - Using this flag will make project to output all debug information on standard output. This helps in debugging in case there is any bug
	-[-verbose] - This flag will make project to output the LOGS including debugging information on standard output.
	-without any flag - This flag will produce only result
